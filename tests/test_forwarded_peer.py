"""R1.2: this component trusts no forwarding header.

Roadmap `docs/design/release-roadmap.md` §2.2, finding review §6.1 #1.

The finding's sharp end is the login limiter, which lives on the agent
and the control root. This component has no login — and the rule is
still all five entrypoints, for two reasons that are not tidiness.

uvicorn's `ProxyHeadersMiddleware` is on by default and trusts
`X-Forwarded-For` from `127.0.0.1`; every request this component ever
receives arrives over loopback, from the gateway, from an agent, or
from the browser's proxy. So `scope["client"]` here is
caller-controlled today, in the access log and in anything that reads
it tomorrow — and *tomorrow* is the case worth pinning, because the next
per-source decision written in this repo would inherit a peer that any
caller can set, with nothing to tell its author.

Driving `main()` rather than reading the source: the subject is what
the entrypoint passes, and a text check goes green the moment somebody
writes the kwarg into a comment.
