"""One directory on this host, listed for a path picker (M11).

Behind `GET /v1/directories`: the picker `path_list` has promised since
M2 -- *"an add/remove list of directory pickers"* -- finally has
something to list. On the library that is its model roots; the agent
carries the same module for a path mapping's `to` and an engine binary.
**Two copies, one schema**, which is this project's rule: components
share schemas, not code, and eighty lines duplicated is cheaper than a
shared package that every component would have to install into the
agent's venv.

What it is not: a file browser. It lists what an operator could already
type into a path field, on request, to the strongest credential there
is -- and nothing else. A directory the component may not read is a
403, an entry it may not stat is skipped, and a dead network share
blocks for as long as the OS takes to give up, which is why the route
that calls this is a plain `def` and runs in a worker thread.
